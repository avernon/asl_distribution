/**
 * Indicates that a given interface is secured by an authentication mechanism.
 *
 * Valid value declarations are:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>required(default value) - interface methods on the interface can only be
 *   called by an authenticated peer</li>
 *   <li>off - if security is off interface authentication is never required
 *   even when implemented by a secure object.</li>
 *   <li>inherit - if the Secure annotation is omitted the interface will use a
 *   security of inherit.  If security is inherit or security is not specified for an
 *   interface the interface inherits the security of the objects that implements
 *   the interface.</li>
 *   <li>if an unknown value is given inherit will be used</li>
